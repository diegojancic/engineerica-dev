Engineerica’s Developer Hub website provides a collection of APIs that allow you to interact with our software products. In this guide, we will explore how to use Engineerica’s AccuCampus API to: 

- [Create a new user](../gettingstarted/login) 
- [Create or edit a college department](../gettingstarted/create-department)
- [Send a SMS with the link to the AccuCampus app](../gettingstarted/send-sms)

Engineerica’s APIs use the JSON format for accepting and responding to HTTP requests. Our APIs also use HTTP response status codes to indicate whether a specific request has been successfully completed. 

You can use cURL (or a different HTTP/REST library of your choice) to directly make requests to the API, or you can make use of one of our SDKs.

 > We have over 10 SDKs available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/engineerica/engineerica-dev/tree/master/client-libraries) for the AccuCampus, AccuClub, and AccuTraining platforms. Please refer to the README documents for instructions on how to download and install a particular SDK.
