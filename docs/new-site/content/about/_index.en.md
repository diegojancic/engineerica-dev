Welcome to Engineerica's API! You can use this website to view the API documentation for our AccuCampus, AccuClub, and AccuTraining platforms. 

The documentation is accessible through the navigation menu at the top of the page: 


>/Docs/AccuCampus      > AccuCampus API Documentation 

>/Docs/AccuClub        > AccuTraining API Documentation 

>/Docs/AccuTraining    > AccuTraining API Documentation
 

Each of these APIs is organized around REST, and you can view the API endpoints for login, logout, search, and much more. The details provided for each endpoint include its name and description, path, HTTP method type, usage and SDK examples, scopes, parameters, and responses.

If you aren't sure where to begin, check out our [__Getting Started__ ](/gettingstarted)page.
